# ENSF338-W23-Assignment-3

### Due by March 13 2023, end of day (Mountain Time)
## Instructions
### In order to complete this assignment, you must prepare a document in PDF format with the answer to each question. Several questions will also ask you to provide the code you implemented, specifying the name the file must have. These questions will specify the name of a source code file in bold font (example: ex1.2.1.py). You must also prepare these source code files and upload them to the GitHub classroom repository for the class (you will receive separate instructions on how to create that). Once you completed the assignment, you must add a link to your repository prior to the answers. Then, you must upload only the PDF document to the “Assignment 3” D2L drop box for your group. You must do so by the assignment deadline.

## Work distribution among team members
### Each group member should strive to contribute approximately equally to the solution. When you prepare your answers document, you must create a section called “Work performed by each member” at the beginning of the document. In this section, you must specify clearly (1) what each member contributed to the solution, and (2) a rough estimate of the amount of work (as a percentage) performed by each member. We will not discuss or address any complaint about group members if based on something different than what presented in this section.
## Answering the questions
### Answers must consist of your own work based on the content discussed in lectures and labs. You may discuss assignments with your classmates, but each group must provide their own solutions to the questions. It is permitted to use AI/Q&A websites as an aid to produce code. Any other use of external help will constitute academic misconduct and sanctioned as such. 
## Late submission policy
### • No late penalty for submissions up to 1H after the deadline
### • Late submissions delivered between 1H and 24H after the deadline: 20% penalty
### • Late submissions delivered more than 24H after the deadline will not be graded (i.e., they will receive 0 points)
### • Deadlines are strict
